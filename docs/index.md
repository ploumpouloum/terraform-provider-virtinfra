# virtinfra Provider

The VirtInfra provider is used to interact with VirtInfra client. For now, the VirtInfra client supports
only local files to store the "virtual infrastructure" deployed. The provider needs to be configured with
a path to a writable JSON file storing this "virtual infrastructure".

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources and data sources.

## Example Usage

Terraform 0.13 and later:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    virtinfra = {
      version = "0.0.1"
      source  = "ploumpouloum.com/ploumpouloum/virtinfra"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the VirtInfra Provider
provider "virtinfra" {
  local_file_location = "/mypath/account_1.json" # Path to any writable JSON file to store infrastructure
}

# Create a VPC
resource "virtinfra_vpc" "example" {
  cidr = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

## Argument Reference

In addition to [generic `provider` arguments](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html)
(e.g. `alias`), the following arguments are supported in the VirtInfra
 `provider` block:

* `local_file_location` (Required, String) Path to the writable JSON file which will be used to store infrastructure
